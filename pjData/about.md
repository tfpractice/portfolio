`I am a self-taught full-stack web developer with a passion for programming. Ive spent the past five years teaching myself how to program in a number of languages, paradigms, frameworks. My current interest is in writing functional javascript libraries, extended for use in apps rendered with react and redux. Here you will find samples of my applications, my libraries, and information on my work as an educator.

Coming from an arts background, I treat coding as craft, and am  constantly exploring the limits of programming languages. I've become an expert at refactoring. and written and rewritten apps with Java, PHP, Wordpress, Ruby on Rails.  I'm particularly interested in translating class-based object oriented code in more extensible functional paradigm. Beyond the specifics of  passing tests, I'm interested in application architecture, testability, and data visualization. I write code, and I write it well.

Having been self-taught, I've become familiar first-hand with any of the pleasures and perils of programming. This makes me an excellent educator. Ive done private tutoring for new developers, and have spent a year training full-stack Javascript development at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From describing command-line navigation as a Matroyshka doll, to demonstrating the power of context manipulation, working with more than 70 students has sharpened my communication skills. I work very well in teams.

## Ease Through Architecture 
For me, an application should involve as little logic on the front end as possible. My applications are mostly an accumulation of separate libraries with a database and a rendering engine. This allows me to focus on more interesting architectural concerns. Not to mention the savings brought on my static deployment and server rendering.

When it comes to writing in Javascript, React with redux + MongoDB have been the most fruitful for me. Redux has allowed my functional stuyle to flourish using thunks and reducers,....
