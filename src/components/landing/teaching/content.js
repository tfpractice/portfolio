## Autodidact and Educator
Having been self-taught, I've become familiar first-hand with any of the pleasures and perils of programming. This makes me an excellent educator. Ive done private tutoring for new developers, and have spent a year training full-stack Javascript development at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From describing command-line navigation as a Matroyshka doll, to demonstrating the power of context manipulation, working with more than 70 students has sharpened my communication skills. I work very well in teams.

  `Theory helped me tremendously on my journey in learning web development. He knowledgeably challenged my thinking and stoked within me a fire and thirst for greater knowledge.
  
   Without his help, I would not have learned so quickly nor been able to land my first job as a developer. Moreover, I have mimicked many of his techniques since myself becoming a coding tutor.
  
   I remember early in my studies struggling to understand and solve a problem regarding recursion. Theory asked me several probing questions and directed me towards a solution that pushed me beyond my skills at the time. Not only was I then able to solve the problem on my own but he gave me tools for going to a deeper level.`,
