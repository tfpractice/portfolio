  Being self-taught, I've become familiar first-hand with any of the pleasures and perils of programming. This makes me an excellent educator. Ive done private tutoring for new developers, and have spent a year training full-stack Javascript development at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From describing command-line navigation as a Matroyshka doll, to demonstrating the power of context manipulation, working with more than 70 students has sharpened my communication skills. I work very well in teams.

  I remember early in my studies struggling to understand and solve a problem regarding recursion. Theory asked me several probing questions and directed me towards a solution that pushed me beyond my skills at the time. Not only was I then able to solve the problem on my own but he gave me tools for going to a deeper level.

  Without his help, I would not have learned so quickly nor been able to land my first job as a developer. Moreover, I have mimicked many of his techniques since myself becoming a coding tutor.

  content: `While in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, Theory was most instrumental in my education of software development for the web. His love for technology inspired me to work hard at my education and I still fall back on that inspiration to this day.

  Under his tutelage, I was constantly challenged. Consistently, he questioned my grammar of the code  and how I came to the conclusion of my solutions. He also paid attention to my personal background and created relatable metaphors for me when dealing with new concepts, which I heard him do for many other students as well. Because of this, I gained broader understandings of programming paradigms, how to see them, and how to architect them.

  I am now able to learn complex programming ideas by falling back on the tools he gave me to learn. I would not be the developer I am today without him.`,
