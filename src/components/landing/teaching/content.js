## Educating
Having been self-taught, I've become familiar first-hand with any of the pleasures and perils of programming. This makes me an excellent educator. Ive done private tutoring for new developers, and have spent a year training full-stack Javascript development at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. From describing command-line navigation as a Matroyshka doll, to demonstrating the power of context manipulation, working with more than 70 students has sharpened my communication skills. I work very well in teams.
