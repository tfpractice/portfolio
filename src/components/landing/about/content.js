I am a self-taught full-stack web developer with a passion for programming. Ive spent the past five years teaching myself how to program in a number of languages, paradigms, frameworks. My current interest is in writing functional javascript libraries, extended for use in apps rendered with react and redux. Here you will find samples of my applications, my libraries, and information on my work as an educator.

Coming from an arts background, I treat coding as craft, and am constantly exploring the limits of programming languages. I've become an expert at refactoring. and written and rewritten apps with Java, PHP, Wordpress, Ruby on Rails.  I'm particularly interested in translating class-based object oriented code in more extensible functional paradigm. Beyond the specifics of  passing tests, I'm interested in application architecture, testability, and data visualization. I write code, and I write it well.
