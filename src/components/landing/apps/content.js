Building independent business logic has been central to my development process, making it easy to swap out and explore different databases and rendering engines. This allows me to focus on more interesting architectural concerns and has lead to a plethora of play apps that take themselves too seriously.

In filmratr, I used MongoDB to explore just how far I could take database normalization. Rummy-Redux, through implementing the complex rules of card-games, has been an achivement in API design. And venery is a guess the word app that accidentally became an exercise in natural language processing. Needless to say, I adapt quickly and execute efficiently.`;

 ## Ease Through Architecture 
 For me, an application should involve as little logic on the front end as possible. My applications are mostly an accumulation of separate libraries with a database and a rendering engine. This allows me to focus on more interesting architectural concerns. Not to mention the savings brought on my static deployment and server rendering.

 When it comes to writing in Javascript, React with redux + MongoDB have been the most fruitful for me. Redux has allowed my functional stuyle to flourish using thunks and reducers
  This curiosity leads to a plethora of play apps that take themselves too seriously. In filmratr, I used MongoDB to explore just how far I could take database normalization. Purchasr is a shopping cart allocation deigned with the nextjs framework and apollo client. And venery is a guess the word app that accidentally became an exercise in natural language processing.  Needless to say, I adapt quickly and execute efficiently.`;
