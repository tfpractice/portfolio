  this is one of the projects I've been most proud of, and has given me a great

  no fewer than ten times and in many ways is what made me tha programmer I am today.
  The process involved translating 
  Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, from Java to
  Object-Oriented Javascript, to functional Javascript.
  
  After it's first iterartion, I knew that my purpose was not to simple design
  algortighms, but to put them to use in a nunmber of ways, partiularly in
  designing algorithms for things like tic-tac-toe and playings cards. 
  After the first iteratio, I ran into numerous issues of subclassing and
  extensibility. 
  
  The problems I encountered therein deepened my understanding of the node
  module system, various programming paradigms, and the importance of preferring
  composition over inheritance. It is now used almost
